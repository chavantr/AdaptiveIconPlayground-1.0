# AdaptiveIconPlayground

An Android application for experimenting with [adaptive icons](https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html).

![demo](screenshots/adaptive-icon-playground-demo.gif)

This app finds all installed apps sporting an adaptive icon and displays them in a grid. It then allows you to toggle different mask shapes (approximating how the icon might display on different devices) and explore visual effects may be applied. Currently offered:
- Layer translation parallax based on scroll
- Layer scale parallax based on touch

A settings sheet allows customization of these effects. **Please note** that these effects are purely illustrative and do not reflect any future feature plans. They are fun though üòÅ.

This is not an official Google product.
